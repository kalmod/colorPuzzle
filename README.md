## COLOR PUZZLE

Simple Color Puzzle. 
- Click on the tiles to turn them all blue.
- Clicking a tile turns the adjacent color as well.

3 puzzles created.
- Learned about managing event handlers.
- I wanted to prevent clicks until the animation finished.
- Also added a pointer-event of none to the grid container to prevent clicks once the puzzle has been completed.

### TODO

- A win message
  - I'd like to add some effect to the cells upon winning.
- Better Styling.
